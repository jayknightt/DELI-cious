# DELI-cious Point of Sales Application

## Project Overview

Welcome to the DELI-cious Point of Sales (POS) application project! This application is designed to automate the order process for DELI-cious, a custom sandwich shop. Currently, DELI-cious allows customers to fully customize their sandwich orders. Due to our growing business, we need a system to handle orders more efficiently and ultimately make it available online.

## Features

- **Customizable Sandwich Orders**: Customers can fully customize their sandwich orders with various ingredients.
- **Order Management**: Automates the order-taking process to replace the current paper-based system.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for a modular, maintainable, and scalable solution.

## Objectives

1. **Automate Order Process**: Create a streamlined menu system
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: Implement OOP concepts to create a well-structured and efficient application.


## Technical Approach

This application will be developed using Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles. The following steps outline the development approach:

1. **Class Diagram**: Start by creating a class diagram to identify the necessary classes and interfaces.
2. **Class and Interface Design**: Design classes and interfaces to represent the various components of the POS system.
3. **Implementation**: Develop the application using Java (or another OOP language) to implement the designed classes and interfaces.


## Class Diagram

Before implementing the solution, a class diagram should be created to visualize the structure of the system. The class diagram will include:

- **Classes**: Represent the main entities in the system (e.g., Order, Sandwich, Customer, Ingredient).
- **Interfaces**: Define common behaviors and interactions between classes.
- **Relationships**: Show the associations, inheritances, and dependencies between classes.

## Development Steps

1. **Define Requirements**: Gather detailed requirements for the POS application.
2. **Create Class Diagram**: Design the class diagram based on the requirements.
3. **Implement Classes**: Write the code for the defined classes and interfaces.
4. **Develop User Interface**: Create a user interface for taking and managing orders.
5. **Test Application**: Perform thorough testing to ensure the application works as expected.
6. **Deploy Solution**: Deploy the application for use in the DELI-cious sandwich shop.

## Future Enhancements

- **Online Ordering**: Integrate online ordering capabilities to expand the reach of DELI-cious.
- **Inventory Management**: Add features to manage inventory and track ingredient usage.
- **Reporting**: Implement reporting tools to analyze sales and customer preferences.
